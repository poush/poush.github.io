A short simple guide to set up oracle database 11g on your windows system.

## 1. Downloading Oracle 11g express
Go to this [page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/express-edition/downloads/index.html) to get download links


Choose *x64* if you have 64bit system or *x32* for 32bit system. If you are not sure just select *x32* one.

You will be required to signup and login to download this

and on completing the signup and login, your download will start.

## 2. Installing Oracle 11g
An obvious step is to extract the downloaded zip

What's next start with double-clicking setup.exe :D

You will be asked for a password. You can put any password you want here but for now I'm putting "root" as password

Now complete setup process and that's all in installation.

## 3. Using Oracle 11g

Go to your start menu and search for "SQL" you will see something "Run SQL Command Line". Open it.

### Now how to connect ? Simple!
You can directly use "Sysdba" user or if you want you can use it to create more users.

Here's how you can login using sysdba user

Now after this you can directly use SQL commands or if you prefer, create new user to use.
